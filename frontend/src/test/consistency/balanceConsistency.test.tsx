/**
 * Concept: **available balance**.
 * Canonical source: `availableBalance` in `FinanceContext`, derived as
 * `max(0, manualBalance + totalIncome - totalSpent)`.
 *
 * This is the concept the original bug report was about, and the audit found it
 * still broken on screen. The context's derivation had been corrected, but
 * `BalanceOverview` — the headline card — kept its own inline copy of the
 * *pre-fix* formula, `manualBalance - totalSpent`, which omits income. The
 * canonical value had zero readers anywhere in the app.
 *
 * So the fix was never actually delivered to the user: recording a salary still
 * changed nothing on the card while recording a coffee did. These tests assert
 * the rendered figure, not the context value, because the context value was
 * already right the whole time.
