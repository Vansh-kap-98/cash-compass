/**
 * Concept: **recurring charge / subscription**.

 *
 * Consumers asserted here: Fixed Liabilities (`SubscriptionTracker`) and the
 * dashboard Insight Box. The Workspace Waste Auditor reads the same function
 * and is covered by the direct-agreement test rather than rendered, because
 * mounting it requires the whole dnd-kit canvas — see
 * `dataDependencyMap.md` for why that consumer is listed but not rendered.
 *
 * The bug this suite exists to prevent: before it, three consumers each
 * implemented their own idea of "recurring", so a single Spotify charge was
 * reported as a subscription by the Insight Box, denied by Fixed Liabilities,
 * and ignored entirely by the Waste Auditor, which rendered a hardcoded list.
