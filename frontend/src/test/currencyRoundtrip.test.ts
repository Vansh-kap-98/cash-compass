 * Guards the store-then-display round trip.
 *
 * Mirrors `mobile/test/currency_roundtrip_test.dart`. Regression test for a
 * real report: entering 50,000 with the app on INR showed 49,999.83 back.
 * `convertToUSD` was rounding to cents before persisting, and one US cent is
 * nearly a rupee — so the stored value was quantised and the error biased in
 * one direction rather than cancelling out. At small amounts it was severe:
 * ₹1 round-tripped to ₹0.83.
 *
 * The conversion maths lives inside a React context, so these tests exercise
 * the same two expressions directly rather than mounting a provider. If the
 * context's formulas change, change them here too.
