/**
 * The one definition of "recurring charge" in the web app.
 *
 * Before this module there were four, and they disagreed:
 *
 * 1. `SubscriptionTracker` ran real cadence detection (≥2 charges, monthly
 *    spacing, consistent amounts) — the strictest of the four.
 * 2. `InsightBox` matched a hardcoded merchant regex
 *    (`/netflix|spotify|subscription|prime|youtube/i`) that fires on a *single*
 *    transaction and cannot see a recurring charge from any other merchant.
 * 3. The Workspace "Waste Auditor" rendered a literal array — Streaming
 *    $15.99, Cloud Storage $9.99, Gym $49.99 — and read no user data at all.
 * 4. `QuickActions` wrote `Recurring: monthly` into the transaction note and
 *    nothing ever read it back.
 *
 * That is why one Spotify charge appeared in the Insight Box and not in Fixed
 * Liabilities. Every consumer now reads this module instead.
 *
 * The rules are a deliberate port of `mobile/lib/logic/subscriptions.dart`,
 * which is the more rigorous of the two implementations and is unit-tested on
 * that side. Mirroring it rather than keeping the looser web rules means the
 * phone and the browser answer this question identically — see
 * `mobile/PARITY_SPEC.md` for why that matters.
